## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational purposes only, and I am not responsible for using any of the techniques described here for illegal usage.

## Prerequisites

While I've written **Hack Steps** for each lab to guide you in writing scripts, the repository assumes that you already know how to solve the labs and want to do so using scripts to practice writing robust ones. That means you may not find a detailed explanation for some payloads.

## Utilizing Burp Suite

I utilized the Burp Collaborator in labs requiring out-of-band interactions. To follow these labs, you'll need a licensed version of Burp Pro, or you can modify the scripts to utilize a remote server under your control.

## Easy Labs

There are some labs that you may find trivial in their solutions and don't necessarily require a script. In fact, solving them without a script might be faster and easier. I have only written scripts for these labs for the completeness of this repository. Feel free to skip them if you prefer.

## Error Handling

Since this repository is intended for learning, I've omitted some error handling to keep things simple. I believe this won't significantly impact your testing of scripts.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement while working with these scripts, feel free to open an issue.
Your feedback is valuable, and I appreciate your contributions to enhance the learning experience for everyone.

## Why Rust?

Rust gives you speed (as if you write C code) and a high level of interfaces and API (as if you write Python code). Due to its power and speed, it evolved rapidly in much areas. Big companies now are migrating to Rust (If they are not alreay did). We can also leverage its power and making our tests more efficient than ever. That's why I created this repositroy.

Although learning Rust can be challenging due to its steep learning curve, with time, you will develop a deep appreciation for the language and become proficient in writing code with it.

## Multi-threaded Programming ðŸš€

You can leverage multi-threading to achieve significantly higher speed in your tests. In fact, you can write a script that is **10** times faster than a single-threaded one. That is why I have written a multi-threaded version for the labs that require the use of brute force technique to solve them.

These multi-threaded scripts are not perfectly written as final code for a thread-safe program due to concurrent issues; they may fail at times due to these issues. However, in most cases, they will work as you expect.

## Rust Alternatives

At the begining, you may find that it so difficult to write Rust code and you will want to get back to python. Don't give up easly!

If you insist and don't get comfrotable with Rust, you can check out [WebSecurity Academy with Python](https://github.com/elqal3awii/WebSecurity-Academy-with-Python) repository in which I have solved the same labs using Python.

## Support âœ¨
